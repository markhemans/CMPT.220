McBlank
(A Shakespearean Sonnet)


McBlank! McBlank! McBlank! Beware McBlank!
He strides and stops to stare for Show! Oh what
A wicked fellow he! To Come to class
A Minute late! To think he sees the class
By minute earl! Brought by eyes that bleed
Contempt. Oh for a man to put away
His childish ways. Thus by a nights like this
In place of sleeping be, the time th’untie
Will he, a mystery of darkness
Employ his mind! by th’occupation
Whereby a barter for sleeping, McBlank
Finds rest removed from the body, alas
It must be from the mind, perchance tis the
Reason why it remains alert during
The passing of the night. Whence the action
Of dreaming be, he must prove a tiresome he!
